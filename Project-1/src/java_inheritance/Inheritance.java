/* Acquiring all the properties(Variables) behavior(Methods) from one class to another class is called inheritance.
 * Objective :- Re-usability avoid duplication. 
 * inheritance can make 2 ways 
 1) Is-A it is formed by using extend keyword
 2) Has-A it is formed by creating parents class object in child class. 
 * Types of inheritance 
 1) Single inheritance : it contains 2 classes one super class and other other sub class. sub class is inheriting super class. its may be same 
 package or different package. 
 2) Multilevel inheritance : it contains two or more than tow classes available in single chain class. two classes or more than tow classes is 
 inheriting one super class. if we created object for sub class 2 then we can access properties of sub class 1 and super class. 
 3) Hierarchical inheritance : It is tree structure one super class has multiple sub classes.
 4) Multiple inheritance : It contains more than one super class, sub class can inherit either super class-1 or super class-2 but super class 
 can not extend sub class. 
 5) Hybrid inheritance : The combination of every type of inheritance is known as hybrid inheritance.
